# babel-plugin-alt-main

```sh
npm install babel-plugin-alt-main --save-dev
```

### Usage

In your `.babelrc`,

```json
{
  "plugins": ["alt-main"]
}
```

+ If you're using it with webpack, consider using the `webpack-plugin` instead as it supports modulesDirectories and extensions options configured under webpack options.
